            was a Japanese manga artist. He was best known for his dark fantasy
            series Berserk, which began serialization in 1989 and continued
            until his death. By 2023, Berserk had over 60 million copies in
            circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all
            time. In 2002, Miura received the Award for Excellence at the sixth
            Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize.

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Miura was born on July 11, 1966, in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.[1]
          In 1976, at the age of 10, he created his first manga, entitled
          Miuranger, which was published for his classmates in a school
          publication; the series ended up spanning 40 volumes.[2] In 1977,
          Miura created his second manga, Ken e no Michi (剣への道, "The Way to
          the Sword"), in which he used India ink for the first time. When he
          was in middle school in 1979, his drawing techniques improved greatly
          as he started using professional drawing techniques.[3] While in high
          school in 1982, Miura enrolled in an artistic curriculum, where he and
          his classmates started publishing their works in school booklets.[3]
          There, he befriended his later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori [ja].
          They both co-authored a science fiction doujinshi which was sent to
          Weekly Shōnen Sunday, but was shot down in the last round of
          selections.[4] At age 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant to
          George Morikawa, of Hajime no Ippo fame. Morikawa quickly acknowledged
          Miura's high artistic level and dismissed him, saying there was
          nothing he could teach that Miura did not already know.[5][6] By then,
          Miura had a dark warrior with a gigantic sword already illustrated in
          his portfolio.[7][8]

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          In 1985, Miura applied for entrance to the art college of Nihon
          University. He submitted a short project, Futatabi (再び, "Once
          More"), for examination and was granted admission. The project later
          earned him the 34th Newcomer Manga Award from Weekly Shōnen
          Magazine.[2] Miura's next work, NOA, was published in Fresh Magazine
          in the same year,[9][2] but it was not successful.[10] In 1988, while
          working for Buronson on a project titled King of Wolves (王狼,
          Ōrō),[5] Miura published a prototype of Berserk in Hakusensha's
          Monthly ComiComi;[1][11] the 48-page prototype placed second in
          ComiComi's seventh Manga School competition.[12] The full
          serialization of Berserk, which would become Miura's most famous and
          successful work, began in Hakusensha's Monthly Animal House in
          1989.[3] In 1990, a sequel to King of Wolves, entitled Ōrō Den
          (王狼伝, "Legend of the King of Wolves"), was published in the same
          magazine.[13] In 1992, Monthly Animal House was renamed Young Animal,
          where Berserk continued serialization. In the same year, Miura
          collaborated with Buronson on the manga Japan, which was also
          published in Young Animal.[14]
          <br />
          In 1997, Miura supervised the production of a 25-episode anime
          adaptation of Berserk produced by OLM, Inc., which aired in the same
          year on NTV. He also supervised the 1999 Dreamcast video game Sword of
          the Berserk: Guts' Rage. In 2002, Miura received the Award for
          Excellence at the sixth Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes for
          Berserk.[12][15] Starting in 2006, Berserk went on frequent and often
          extended hiatuses,[16] and alternated between monthly and irregular
          serialization. By 2023, Berserk was collected into 42 tankōbon volumes
          in Japan, and by September 2023, it had over 60 million copies in
          circulation worldwide, including digital versions.[17] The series also
          spawned a host of merchandise, both official and fan-made, ranging
          from statues, action figures to key rings, video games, and a trading
          card game. Various art books and supplemental materials by Miura based
          on Berserk were also released.
          <br />
          In 2013, Miura released the short standalone manga Giganto Maxia,
          published in English-speaking territories by Dark Horse in 2016.[18]
          Duranki, a short manga produced by Miura's personal manga studio
          Studio Gaga, was serialized in Young Animal Zero in 2019.[19]

        <h2>Influences</h2>
        <p>
          Miura stated that the work that had the biggest impact on his own was
          Buronson and Tetsuo Hara's manga Fist of the North Star (1983
          debut).[20] Miura also cited influences from Go Nagai's Violence Jack
          (1973 debut), the Japanese fantasy novel series Guin Saga (1979
          debut), Paul Verhoeven films, the Hellraiser series (1987 debut),
          shōjo manga, Disney films, and the works of Hieronymous Bosch, M. C.
          Escher, Gustave Doré, and Pieter Bruegel.[21]

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          On May 6, 2021, Miura died due to acute aortic dissection, at the age
          of 54. His death was publicly announced on May 20, 2021.[22][23] A
          private ceremony was held by his family.[13]
          <br />
          Various manga artists offered condolences, including Kouji Mori,
          Miura's high school friend,[24] and George Morikawa, who shared a
          story of their friendship.[8] People who worked on the Berserk anime
          adaptations also paid tribute to Miura, including Susumu Hirasawa,
          composer for the 1997 series;[8] Nobutoshi Canna and Yūko Miyamura,
          who voiced Guts and Casca, respectively, in the 1997 series;[25]
          Hiroaki Iwanaga, Guts' voice actor since the 2012–13 film trilogy;[25]
          and singer Yoshino Nanjō, who voiced Sonia and performed the ending
          theme for the 2016 series' second season with Nagi Yanagi.[8]

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time,[26] Miura's
          series Berserk impacted the manga medium and beyond, with journalist
          Jade King stating: "[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous
          impact his work has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and
          even literature." The image of Guts and his massive sword is
          attributed to inspiring characters like Cloud Strife of Final Fantasy
          VII and Dante from the Devil May Cry series, with the overall
          aesthetic of Berserk inspiring the monsters and world of the Dark
          Souls series.[27][28] Video game director Hideaki Itsuno and producer
          Hiroyuki Kobayashi are fans of Berserk, and the role-playing hack and
          slash game Dragon's Dogma includes armor based on Guts and
          Griffith's.[29][30] During a GDC talk in 2019, Itsuno stated that the
          tone and style of Devil May Cry 5 was inspired from Berserk.[31]
          <br />
          Many authors have cited Miura and Berserk as influences, including
          Blue Exorcist author Kazue Kato,[32] Baccano! and Durarara!! author
          Ryōgo Narita,[33] Black Butler author Yana Toboso,[24] Black Clover
          author Yūki Tabata,[34] and Attack on Titan author Hajime Isayama, who
          called it "tremendous, just magnificent [...] I got the impression
          that it was very well organized like a movie".[35] Yoko Taro stated
          that the protagonist of Drakengard, Caim, was inspired by Berserk's
          protagonist Guts.[36]
          <br />
          A "memorial" Young Animal issue dedicated to Miura was released on
          September 10, 2021. Besides the inclusion of the posthumous chapter
          364 of Berserk, the issue featured a special "Messages to Kentarou
          Miura" booklet and a poster of "famous scenes" from the manga.[37][38]
          In the issue, manga artist Kouji Mori, Miura's long-time friend,
          published a one-shot titled "Mori-chan Ken-chan", which tells the
          story of Mori's friendship with Miura.[39]
          <br />
          On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and Kouji Mori announced that Berserk
          would continue publication, using plans and thoughts that were relayed
          to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memorandums and character designs
          that Miura left behind.[40] As the only person who knows the ending
          Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and promised: "I
          will only write the episodes that Miura talked to me about. I will not
          flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I don't remember clearly.
          I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to
          me."[40] The credits appear as "original work by Kentaro Miura, art by
          Studio Gaga, supervised by Kouji Mori".[40][41][42]
